Claude Desktop - flat monthly fee, with a usage limit that refreshes over time
Claude API - usage based pricing (that can really add up if you're not careful)

Project plan:
- Auto git commit after every edit so rollbacks work
- Prevent edits to files which are not under VC (so rollbacks work)
- Add files to context
- Set a base directory (so I don't always have to do absolute paths)
- We want a single tool, so that we only get asked to approve once per session
- Import in all the Aider system prompts (maybe via a Project?)

Cherry on top:
- Load a webpage
- Running tests/lints/typecheck

(Chat editing concept is bad)
